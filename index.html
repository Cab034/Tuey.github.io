                Our thinnest, lightest notebook, completely transformed by the Apple M1 chip. CPU speeds up to 3.5x
                faster. GPU speeds up to 5x faster. Our most advanced Neural Engine for up to 9x faster machine
                learning. The longest battery life ever in a MacBook Air. And a silent, fanless design. This much power
                has never been this ready to go.</p>

            <p>
                It’s here. Our first chip designed specifically for Mac. Packed with an astonishing 16 billion
                transistors, the Apple M1 system on a chip (SoC) integrates the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, I/O, and so
                much more onto a single tiny chip. With incredible performance, custom technologies, and
                industry-leading power efficiency,1 M1 is not just a next step for Mac — it’s another level entirely.

                Easy to learn. Astoundingly powerful. Battery life beyond belief. Mac is designed to let you work, play,
                and create in ways you never imagined. It comes loaded with apps that are ready to go right out of the
                box. Free, regular software updates keep things up to date and running smoothly. And if you already have
                an iPhone, it feels familiar from the moment you turn it on.</p>
